#Inheritance:

#Using the properties of one class into another class:

#we can use the properties of one class into another class in 2 ways
1.Has-A relationship
2.Is-A relationship

1.Has-A relationship: using classname or ref_variable name, we can use the
                    properties of one class or module in another
                    class or module
2.Is-A relationship: without classname or ref_variable name or modulename,
                    we can use the properties of one class in another class.

Is-A relationship, we can implement  in python by using inheritance.
