#COLLECTIONS :4 Types

1.List--->[ ]
2.Tuple-->()
3.Set --->{}
4.Dictionary->{K:v}

#List: List is a collection datatype which holds group of values

#List properties:

1.List is represented using [].

2.List allows both homogeneous elements(similar) and heterogeneous elements(dissimilar)
  x=[10,20,30,40,50] --->homogeneous
  y=[101,"Ajay",90870.40]

3.List allows duplicate element  ex:  x=[10,20,30,40,50,10,20,30]

4.In List,Insertion order is preserved i.e the order in which the elements are inserted
  in the same order they are stored or displayed

5.Each element of a list is represented or accessed by a unique index
  List supports 2 types of indexes:
      1.Forward index (or) Positive index--->starts from left to right--->starts with 0
      2.Backward index(or) Negative index--->starts from right to left--->starts with -1.

6.List is a mutable object i.e changes and modifications are allowed within a list.
  but elements of a list can be either mutable or immutable
  x=[10,20,30,34.5,[10,20,30]]

7.list can also be created using list() function
