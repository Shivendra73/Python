poly----->many
morphism-->many forms or functionalities or logics

ex: deposit------>cash or DD or cheque

Def: The concept of defining multiple fuctionalities or logics to perform
     an operation is known as polymorphism.

Types of Polymorphism: 2types
    1.Static Polymorphism or compile-time polymorphism:
        ex: Method overloading
            But Method overloading is not supported by python
            
    2.Dynamic Polymorphism or Run-time polymorphism
        ex:Method overriding


Method overloading: Defining 2 or more methods with same name but with
                    different no of arguments or types of arguments.
      ex:def add(a,b,c):
            .........
            ........

         def add(x,y):
             .......
             .......
         def add(p):
              .....
              .....
