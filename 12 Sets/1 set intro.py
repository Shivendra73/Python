
SET:SET is a collection datatype which holds group of values.

Properties of SET:

1.Set represented by using curly braces {  }

2.Set allows homogeneous elements.  ex;  x={10,20,30,40,50}

3.Set allows heterogeneous elements. ex: x={501,6.1,True,"hello"}

4.Set doesn't allow duplicates.  ex: x={10,20,30,40,50,10,20,30}

5.In Set, insertion order is not preserved i.e the way they are inserted ,
  in the same order they are not stored or displayed.

6.Set doesn't support indexing.
  we cannot access elements of set using index, print(x[1]) is invalid.
  we can access the elements of a set using for loop,
  we cannot access using while loop also because while loop requires index.

7.Set is a mutable object, but elements of set should be immutable only.

8.Set can be created directly by using { } or by using set() function.

9.sets within a set is not allowed bcoz set allows only immutables within it.

10.we can perform mathematical operations on a set object.
  ex: max,min,sorted------>applied on homogeneous elements.
