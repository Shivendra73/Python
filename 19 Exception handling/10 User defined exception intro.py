The exceptions which are defined by the programmers explicitly accordingto
their bussiness requirements are known as userdefined exceptions.

steps to implement user-defined exceptions

1.defining user-defined exception class
2.Raising the Exception
3.Handling the Exception.



1)Defining user-defined Exception class:
    A user-defined Exception class that extends any one of the pre-defined exception class
    then the class is called user-defined Exception class.


    syntax:   class classname(Exception):
                    pass
              
2)Raising the Exception:
    we can raise the exceptions by using raise keyword.

    syntax:

        raise exceptionclassname
    
    we can also raise the pre-defined exceptions explicitly by using raise keyword.

    Creating exception class object explicitly is known as the raising the exception.

-predefined exceptions raised automatically

-user-defined exceptions ,we need to raise explicitly by using raise keyword.



3)Handling the exception:
    -we can handle the raised exception by using try and except blocks.
