

Constructor :Constructor is a special kind of method which is used to initialize
             the non-static variables of a class at the time of creation of
             the object.

Properties of a constructor:
    
1.Constructors are used to initialize NSV's of a class during object
 creation only.
2.Constructor executed automatically whenever object is created.
  but normal methods we need to call using object.
3.For one object,constructor will be executed only once,bcoz only once
  we initialize
4.Constructor should always be defined with the name __init__()

syntax: def __init__(self,parameters):

  Difference between Methods and constructors
           Methods                      Constructors
1.Method name can be any name         1.Constructor name should be __init__()
2.Methods are used to represent       2.Constructors are used to initialize
  the Bussiness logics to               the Non-static variables of a class
  perform the operations
3.Method will be executed whenever    3.Constructor will be executed automatically
  we make a method call using object    whenever we create a object.
4.with respect to one object          4.with respect to one object, 
  one method can be called for          a constuctor will be executed only once.
  'n' no of times.

Constructors are of 2 types:
    i)Default Constructor      :  A Constructor without parameters
   ii)Parameterized Constructor:  A Constructor with parameters
