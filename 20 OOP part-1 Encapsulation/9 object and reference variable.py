        variable of a class at the time of execution of the
        program is known as a object

      Instance of a class is known as a object
      syntax of object:
          refvariable=classname() #object creation stmt
      here refvariable stores address of the object(in-direct address)
      

      Reference variable:whenever object is created,that memory
      location address of the object is taken by
      python interpreter and creates indirect address
      and this indirect address is allocated to a variable
      called reference variable.

       Using reference variable,we do the following.
       
       1.we can put data into the object
       2.we can get the data from the object
       3.we can call the methods on that object.
       We can create 'n' no of objects for a class
       2 different objects of the same class also doesn't
       contain same indirect address.
