
#Tuples: Tuple is a collection datatype which holds group of values

#Tuple Properties:

1.Tuple represented using ()

2.Tuple allows both homogenous(same datatype) and heterogeneous(different datatype) elements
  ex:  x=(10,20,30,40,50)   #homogenous elements
       y=(101,"James",70890.70,[1,2,3]) #heterogeneous elements

3. Tuple allows duplicate elements   ex:  x=(10,20,30,10,20)

4. In tuple insertion order is preserved ,i.e the order in which the elements are inserted
   in the same order they are stored or displayed

5. Every element of a tuple,is identified or accessed by a unique index
   tuple support 2 types of indexes:
       1.Forward index (or) Positive index---->starts from left to right----->starts with 0
       2.Backward index(or) Negative index----->Starts from right to left---->starts with -1.

6. Tuple is a immutable object i,e changes and modifications are not allowed within a tuple
    but elements of a tuple can be either mutable or immutable
    ex: y=(101,"James",70890.70,[1,2,3])
        
    
7. tuple can also be created by using tuple() function
